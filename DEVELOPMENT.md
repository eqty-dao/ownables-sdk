## A Guide for Devs and Builders: Working with Ownables

As the Ownables ecosystem grows, the need for robust tooling and clear developer guidelines becomes essential. This guide walks you through how to structure and send Ownables using the SDK and relay infrastructure.

If you're building Ownables or integrating them into your app, this guide is for you.

### 🔧 Structuring Your Ownable Message

Each Ownable is packaged and sent between wallets using the Relay Server.

To ensure your Ownable can be **previewed before download**, you should include a **`thumbnail.webp`** file inside the Ownable zip package.

#### 📸 Thumbnail Guidelines:

- File name must be: `thumbnail.webp`
- Maximum file size: **256 KB**
- Format: `.webp` (required)
- This preview is used by clients to render a quick snapshot of the Ownable before the user chooses to download it.

> **Note**: In the official SDK, thumbnail resizing is handled automatically when you initiate a transfer. However, in custom apps, you may need to handle resizing manually depending on your use case.

### 🚀 Sending Ownables

Ownables can be sent directly between wallets using the Relay Server, which supports:

- End-to-end encrypted delivery
- File previews (when `thumbnail.webp` is present)
- Ownable metadata sync

Make sure your message includes the structured Ownable zip with any required metadata or signature files as per the Ownables spec.

### ✅ Quick Checklist for App Integrators:

- [ ] Package your Ownable as a `.zip` file
- [ ] Include `thumbnail.webp` (≤ 256 KB)
- [ ] Use SDK for automatic resizing, or implement your own
- [ ] Send the package using the relay protocol
- [ ] Handle preview rendering on the recipient side
